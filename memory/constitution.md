# Forkable AI Framework - Project Constitution (MVP Focus)

## Project Mission

Build a lean, forkable AI application framework that proves the concept of rapid deployment through configuration-driven development, starting with Gemini 2.5 nano and expanding to multiple providers post-MVP.

## Core Principles

### 1. MVP-First Approach
- **Primary Goal**: Prove the forkable concept works with a single AI provider
- **AI Provider**: Gemini 2.5 nano only (expand to multiple providers post-MVP)
- **Target Users**: You first, then other developers after validation
- **Business Features**: Auth/payments included from start (Klerk + Polar)
- **Mobile Development**: Secondary priority after web validation

### 2. Forkable Architecture
- **One-Line Configuration**: Single configuration changes create entirely new applications
- **Modular Design**: Components can be independently developed and integrated
- **Rapid Deployment**: From configuration to live application in minutes, not weeks
- **Deployment Ready**: Auth/payments pre-configured for immediate deployment

### 3. Web-First Development
- **Web-First**: Robust web application with modern UI/UX
- **Mobile-Secondary**: Native iOS app after web validation
- **Shared Backend**: Single API serves both web and mobile platforms
- **Consistent Experience**: Unified user experience across all platforms

### 4. Production-Ready Infrastructure (MVP)
- **Scalable Architecture**: Serverless, auto-scaling infrastructure
- **Security-First**: Comprehensive security measures and compliance
- **Basic Monitoring**: Essential performance and usage monitoring
- **Automated Deployment**: CI/CD pipelines for rapid iteration

### 5. Developer Experience (Post-MVP)
- **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and API documentation
- **Easy Setup**: Minimal configuration required for deployment
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new features and integrations
- **Community Support**: Active community and support channels

## Technical Standards

### Code Quality
- **Clean Code**: Readable, maintainable, and well-documented code
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and resource efficiency
- **Security**: Security-first development practices

### Architecture
- **Microservices**: Modular, independently deployable components
- **API-First**: Well-defined API contracts and specifications
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous communication between components
- **Cloud-Native**: Designed for cloud deployment and scaling

### Development Process
- **Spec-Driven**: All development based on comprehensive specifications
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Code Reviews**: Peer review for all code changes
- **Documentation**: Up-to-date documentation for all components

## Business Objectives

### MVP Goals
- **Core Functionality**: Working forkable system with Gemini 2.5 nano
- **Business Ready**: Auth/payments integrated and working
- **Deployment**: One example fork deployed and accessible (coloring book sketch)
- **Validation**: Prove the forkable concept works in practice
- **Configuration System**: Single config file for easy forking
- **User Experience**: Upload photo → generate → see result → pay for more

### Post-MVP Goals
- **Multi-Provider**: Add OpenAI, Anthropic, Stability AI
- **Mobile Apps**: React Native iPhone app
- **Developer Platform**: Make it a product for other developers
- **Market Expansion**: Scale to broader developer community

## Business Model

### **Primary Business Model**
- **Multiple AI Image Modification Websites**: Each with different prompt + branding
- **Revenue Stream**: Subscriptions or usage-based payments from end users
- **Cost Structure**: You pay API costs, users pay you for the service
- **Forking Process**: Duplicate codebase → change config file → deploy new website

### **MVP Example Fork**
- **Name**: "ColoringBook AI"
- **Prompt**: "Convert this image into a black and white coloring book style sketch with clear outlines and no shading"
- **User Flow**: Upload photo → click generate → see sketch result → buy tokens for more
- **Payment**: Token-based system with $5 minimum deposit, 3 free generations

### **Configuration System**
- **Single Config File**: Contains prompt, branding, messaging, pricing
- **Easy Forking**: Change one file → deploy → new website with new domain
- **Branding Elements**: Name, logo, tagline, descriptions, header images, examples

### Success Metrics (Post-MVP)
- **User Adoption**: 1,000+ active developers within 6 months
- **Revenue Growth**: $100,000+ monthly recurring revenue within 12 months
- **Platform Usage**: 10,000+ applications deployed through the platform
- **Market Share**: Leading position in AI application development tools

## Quality Assurance
